Partner: mariabrikou
I implemented: 1, 3, 5
Maria imlemented: 2, 4, 6

Git knowledge before the lab: I initially had a basic understanding of Git, using only the features I had needed up until now such as
add, commit, push, pull and fetch changes.

Git knowledge after the lab: I learned how to manage more complex Git workflows and specifically I learned to work with branches, resolve merge conflicts,
use rebase to clean up commit history without creating chaos. Especially for the rebase action I had no idea about before. I didn't even know that it existed!

Maybe not a fun fact but this is the first time I’m doing an assignment so early before the deadline because I’m going on a trip and 
won’t be able to take my laptop with me.
